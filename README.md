# Visualizer
This project is a Java applet designed to run visualizations of different algorithms or simulations. It is designed with the idea that anyone can contribute a visualization for an algorithm of their own choosing!


### Note to Self - Temporary
To compile from Visualizer/ [FOR NOW - this may cause issues when MainFrame starts referencing other classes]
```
javac src/MainFrame.java -d bin/
```
Now it looks like the following command, but I'm keeping the above temporarily
```
javac src/*.java -d bin/
```
To run
```
java -cp bin/ MainFrame
```
